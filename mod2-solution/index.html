    <p><strong class="box1">PLATELETS</strong> 
    <br><br>
    Platelets help the blood to clot.
    Clotting stops the blood from flowing out of the body when a vein or artery is broken.
    Platelets are also called thrombocytes.
    If one of your blood vessels gets damaged, it sends out signals to the platelets. The platelets then rush to the site of damage. they form a plug (clot) to fix the damage.

    <p><strong class="box2">RED BLOOD CELLS</strong>
    <br><br>
    Red blood cells carry oxygen.<br> Of the 3 types of blood cells, red blood cells are the most plentiful. In fact, a healthy adult has about 35 trillion of them. The body creates these cells at a rate of about 2.4 million a second, and they each have a life span of about 120 days. Red blood cells are also called erythrocytes.

    <p><strong class="box3">WHITE BLOOD CELLS</strong>
    <br><br>
    White blood cells ward off infection. <br>These cells, which come in many shapes and sizes, are vital to the immune system. When the body is fighting off infection, it makes them in ever-increasing numbers. Still, compared to the number of red blood cells in the body, the number of white blood cells is low.
